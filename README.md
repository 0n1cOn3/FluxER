# Termux WiFi Hacking
Actively maintained! - Till today :) 

## Installation process

NOTE: This script only works with the Termux application for Android!
PWN-Term is untested!

``
pkg install git
``

``
git clone https://github.com/0n1cOn3/termux-wifi && cd termux-wifi
``

Set permissions on the executable and then run it:

``
chmod +rwx installer.sh && ./installer.sh
``

That's it.

Fluxion has been added and will automatically start on Ubuntu when you try to hack a Wi-Fi.
Good luck!
Thanks for downloading!
